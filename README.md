## HTML Template
HTML + CSS template is located in the `\template` folder.

It's actually fully working solution using the Vanilla JavaScript. It includes two pages: `index.html` and `product.html`

`index.html` is the main application webpage, which has quite simple structure: 
- the main menu and the "Company" logo (the fictitious company is called "Baby's Academy", it's specialized on teaching anyone in wide area of knowledge, but what is important - even babies would understand everything :) );
- the advertisement section, which shows (promotes) one randomly selected course from the list of all available courses;
- funny slogan section;
- the section with the list of all available courses, divided in pages by 10 courses each, together with pagination controls;
- the footer section.




## React powered website
The React solution is located in the `\website` folder.
